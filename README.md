# SwipeShop — Expo skeleton

This is a minimal Expo (TypeScript) scaffold implementing the core features discussed:
- Onboarding (select preferences)
- Home swipe deck (3-card stack, basic like/dislike via drag)
- Wishlist persisted in AsyncStorage
- Product Detail screen
- Profile with Reset Recommendations action

How to use:
1. Install dependencies:
   npm install
   or
   yarn install
   or
   pnpm install

2. Start Expo:
   npx expo start

3. Open on device with Expo Go or run in web.

Notes:
- This is a demo scaffold intended to be imported into Expo Snack or run locally with Expo.
- Backend calls are mocked using `src/api/mockData.ts`. Replace with your API endpoints as you implement the backend.
